# Multi-Press Service Provider for Laravel

Register the provider by adding it to the `providers` array in the `app/config/app.php` file.

You also need to define the config settings for your specific MultiPress server. See the laravel docs section ["Protecting Sensitive Configuration"](http://laravel.com/docs/configuration#protecting-sensitive-configuration).
